I've spent some time investigating data science. It has been a good experience to familiarise
myself with all the best algorithms out there. I'm not actively pursuing expanding my
knowledge in this field anymore, because any company that has machine learning as a core
element of their product should hire a proper Data Scientist with Masters in Statistics.
