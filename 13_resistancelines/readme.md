# Resistance lines
---

## 1. Find resistance lines

## 2. Trend does not matter, so we need to cluster lines into entry and exit regions
- created lines

## 3. Establish crossing frequency on resistance lines
- created cross
**interestingly, do we get the lines from ticks grouped, or by grouped limits?**
it seems going over grouped limits, gives very bad results. let's try rolling lines
- created cross_tick

this is not helpful at all. rolling range values does not help.
